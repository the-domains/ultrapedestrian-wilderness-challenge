**UltraPedestrian Mind/Body Challenge**

For 2016 we are offering a new and unique challenge called the

**Here's the scoop:**

The Route is an out and back from the East Bank Trailhead off Highway 20 in the North Cascades to the north end of Ross Lake and back. Here's the catch: you must summit Desolation Peak twice, on both the out and the back. So the complete route is East Bank Trail to the Desolation Peak trail, summit Desolation (a hike, not a climb), then head up Lightning Creek all the way to the Hozameen Campground, touch the monument at the Canadian Border, then reverse the route, including summiting Desolation a second time.

_That's the Body part._  
**Here's the Mind part:**

Jack Kerouac spent 63 days during the summer of 1956 as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak. He wrote about his experiences in the books Lonesome Traveler, The Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels. To complete the UltraPedestrian Mind/Body Challenge you must read or listen to one or more of the works attributed to this period in Kerouac's career, and in your trip report tie in your experience on the trail to one of the books. This can be done in any way you see fit, through words, pictures, video, song, whatever expression you choose. Anyone who completes the route, reading, and writing assignment will receive a one of a kind finisher's patch.

Only 100 patches have been made. In 2015 two of them were awarded, leaving 98 as yet unclaimed. Once those 98 are handed out to finishers no more patches will be made and the Double Desolation Route will be closed forever.

The entry fee for the 2015 UltraPedestrian Mind/Body Challenge is $25.00 per person. All proceeds beyond the cost of patches and shipping costs will go to support UltraPedestrian.com.
